##Updated Portfolio
For this Assignment, I remade my portfolio to have a more unique and minimalistic design. While I am proud of the current state of the project, I believe it is far from done. I made the mistake of formatting my portfolio on a desktop sized background, so making it mobile friendly has been a challenge. I also planned on making a work history page that would show my work, academic, and volunteer experiences. The portfolio that I will likely end up using permanenlty will likely be made from React, and when that comes I will design it as a mobile first website that has a 3rd page to show work experiences.
